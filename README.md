Type the following commands in your terminal, in your root project folder, to run your project:
- npm install
- npm run dev

Code Meaning
The code allows you to create a new key pair which you'll airdrop 2 Sol into it, but before this is done, the new address should be linked to the solana Devnet where the 2 sol would be airdropped into the account. It then allows you to transfer 1 sol to a phantom wallet.
